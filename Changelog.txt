====        Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK) Changelog            ====
================================================================================

This document should be updated with every release. Major changes
in the trunk version can be listed right on top to simplify creation
of release notes for the next release.



======== New stuff only in the SVN trunk ========

- a PointListWidget


======== Changes in release 0.10 (2008-Oct-??) ========

Application changes:

- application modules for image-based rigid and landmarked-based registration
- optional splash screen
- new level-window widget behaviour (reacts to 2D mouse movements now)
- interactive segmentation tool set now easily extensible by plugins
  (see http://docs.mitk.org/nightly/toolextensions.html)
- Rendering changes:
  - Improved Volume-Rendering: Level-of-Detail Mechanism now works 
    for multiple simultaneous 3D RenderWindows and datasets
  - Experimental: user interaction during volume rendering 
    (enable by setting flag "LOD abort mechanism" in Global Options)

Under-the-hood changes:

- compatibility with ITK 3.8
- build system now produces shared libraries (smaller packages, faster linking)
- support for UnstructuredGrid VTK data
- reworked rendering mechanism
  - rendering Requests are now directly issued via Qt events instead of
    delayed QTimer calls
  - easier integration of standard VTK-props with mitk
  - Added properties for annotating and clipping datasets in 3D windows
- several bug fixes, more testing and minor improvements
- EXPERIMENTAL: Qt4 based application platform based on OSGi and the Eclipse RCP,
    called openCherry. If you want to build modular, service oriented applications
    you can use openCherry as your application platform. Build the platform by
    setting "BUILD_OPENCHERRY=TRUE" (default is FALSE). You are strongly advised
    to regularly update to the SVN HEAD revision since the platform is
    experimental and is being intensively worked on. Use the mitk mailinglist for
    questions - tutorials and documentation will be provided in the near future.
- EXPERIMENTAL: compatibility with VTK 5.2



======== Changes in release 0.8 (2007-Dec-19) ========

- Subversion!
- functionality for slice-by-slice segmentation including interpolation between segmented slices (QmitkInteractiveSegmentation). 
  For more information see http://www.mitk.org/slicebasedsegmentation.html
  - example code for 
    - use of zlib for image compression ( mitk::CompressedImageContainer )
    - observe changes in the slicer/MPR ( QmitkSlicesInterpolator )
    - how to safely implement undo
- MPR planes rotatable
- improved level-window slider including scale marks, definable presets, selection of image to work on, etc.
- additional tutorial step describing functionality creation, see http://www.mitk.org/documentation/doxygen/Step9Page.html
- better build system, esp. those cmake files that need to be changed to add sources are much simpler
- GUI for basic RAW image import (contribution - Xabier ...)
- DataStorage -- needs explanation!
- Progress bar
- always-available modules for standard views and selection of slices
- Level-Of-Detail mechanism for volume rendering
- Textual volume annotation in 2D views
- Two plane rotation modes: axis rotation and swivel rotation
- Rendering of multiple overlapping/semi-transparent image-slices in 3D
- Unified properties for plane reslicing / rendering interpolation modes
- Improved 3D+t concepts; 3D+t support for Surfaces and PointSets
- support for "Connexion 3D SpaceNavigator (TM) Mouse": Activate option MITK_USE_TD_MOUSE in cmake to enable interaction with a connexion 3D mouse in 3D widget.

Minor interface changes to lower command complexibility (-classes::method):
- mitkDataTreeNode::GetInteractor(): now returns a standard C-Pointer, not a SmartPointer. 
- mitkDataTreeNode::GetPropertyList() and ::GetProperty(): now returns a standard C-Pointer, not a SmartPointer. 
- mitkPropertyList::GetProperty(): now returns a standard C-Pointer, not a SmartPointer.
