- Subversion!
- functionality for slice-by-slice segmentation including interpolation between segmented slices (QmitkSliceBasedSegmentation). For more information see http://www.mitk.org/slicebasedsegmentation.html
    - example code for 
      - use of zlib for image compression ( mitk::CompressedImageContainer )
      - observe changes in the slicer/MPR ( QmitkSlicesInterpolator )
      - how to safely implement undo
- MPR planes rotatable
- improved level-window slider including scale marks, definable presets, selection of image to work on, etc.
- additional tutorial step describing functionality creation, see http://www.mitk.org/documentation/doxygen/Step9Page.html
- better build system, esp. those cmake files that need to be changed to add sources are much simpler
- GUI for basic RAW image import (contribution - Xabier ...)
- DataStorage -- needs explanation!
- Progress bar
- always-available modules for standard views and selection of slices
- Level-Of-Detail mechanism for volume rendering
- Textual volume annotation in 2D views
- Two plane rotation modes: axis rotation and swivel rotation
- Rendering of multiple overlapping/semi-transparent image-slices in 3D
- Unified properties for plane reslicing / rendering interpolation modes
- Improved 3D+t concepts; 3D+t support for Surfaces and PointSets
- support for "Connexion 3D SpaceNavigator (TM) Mouse": Activate option MITK_USE_TD_MOUSE in cmake to enable interaction with a connexion 3D mouse in 3D widget.

Minor interface changes to lower command complexibility (-classes::method):
- mitkDataTreeNode::GetInteractor(): now returns a standard C-Pointer, not a SmartPointer. 
- mitkDataTreeNode::GetPropertyList() and ::GetProperty(): now returns a standard C-Pointer, not a SmartPointer. 
- mitkPropertyList::GetProperty(): now returns a standard C-Pointer, not a SmartPointer.
