    - example code for 
      - use of zlib for image compression ( mitk::CompressedImageContainer )
      - observe changes in the slicer/MPR ( QmitkSlicesInterpolator )
      - how to safely implement undo
- MPR planes rotatable
- improved level-window slider including scale marks, definable presets, selection of image to work on, etc.
- additional tutorial step describing functionality creation, see http://www.mitk.org/documentation/doxygen/Step9Page.html
- better build system, esp. those cmake files that need to be changed to add sources are much simpler

- DataStorage -- still some documentation needed 
- Progress bar
- always-available modules for standard views and selection of slices
- Level-Of-Detail mechanism for volume rendering
- Textual volume annotation in 2D views
- Two plane rotation modes: axis rotation and swivel rotation
