\section DataInteractionTechnicalPage_Introduction Description of Interaction Concept Implementation in MITK


\section DispatcherSection Dispatcher

After an event is received by the Dispatcher it is given to a DataInteractor that has to decide if it can process this event.
On a high level this is done by the mitk::EventStateMachine.
First the state machine asks if the received event is known in the
configuration. If it does the matching variant name is returned. Then the state machine checks if there exists a transition
in its current state that is triggered by this event variant. If this is the case all actions that are associated with this transition
are queried and executed. The actions themselves are implemented on DataInteractor level. The following diagram illustrates the process:

Each BaseRenderer creates a mitk::BindDispatcherInteractor object which encapsulates the connection between the DataStorage and the Dispatcher,
and thereby allowing a DataInteractor to register with a Dispatcher when only knowing the DataNode.

BindDispatcherInteractor creates a new Dispatcher object and registers for DataNode events at the DataStorage, as a callback function the
Dispatchers AddDataInteractor() and RemoveDataInteractor() functions are set.

digraph {
  node [shape=record, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
  a [ label="{BaseRenderer|m_BindDispatcherInteractor}"];
  b [ label="{BindDispatcherInteractor|m_Dispatcher\n m_DataStorage}" ];
  c [ label="Dispatcher" ];
  d [ label="DataStorage" ];
  a -> b;
  b -> c;
  b -> d;
}
\enddot

This way the Dispatcher is notified about all changes regarding
DataNodes that are shown in the BaseRenderer. When a node is added, remove or modified the Dispatcher can check it a DataInterator is set,
and accordingly add or remove this DataInteractor from its internal list.

\dot
digraph {
  node [shape=record, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
  d [ label="DataInteractor" ];
  a [ label="DataNode" ];
  b [ label="DataStorage" ];
  c [ label="Dispatcher" ];
  e [ label="BaseRenderer"]
  edge [fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10]
  d -> a [label="SetDataInteractor(this)"];
  a -> b [label="Modified()"];
  b -> c [label="NodeModified(dataNode)"];
  e -> c [label="HandleEvent(interactionEvent)"];
 { rank=same; b c a }
 { rank=same; e }
}
\enddot

Events that are generated within the scope of the BaseRenderer are sent to the associated Dispatcher to be handled.


\subsection DispatcherEventDistSection Event Distribution

 A Dispatcher can operate in different processing modes, which determine how the interactor that receives an event is chosen.
 These modes are managed and set by the Dispatcher itself.

<ul>
 <li> \b Regular: \n
    DataInteractors are sorted by their layer, and distribution is stared with the top-most.

 <li> \bConnected \b Mouse \b Action:

      A connected mouse action is described by the sequence of Mouse-Press, (optionally) Mouse-Move , Mouse-Release Events.\n
      Within this sequence all events are sent to the same DateInteractor, the one which received the event from the Mouse-Press action.\n
      \b m_ConnectedMouseAction  - is set to true, when a Mouse-Down Event occurs and a DataInterator takes the event and
      \b m_SelectedInteractor is then set to this DataInteractor.\n
      \b m_ConnectedMouseAction is reset to false, after the Mouse-Release Event occurs,\n
      while it is true, the m_SelectedInteractor is the only one that receives Mouse-Events.

 <li> \b Grab \b Input:\n
      Whenever a DataInteractor performs a state change into a state that is marked by the grab input-tag, the Dispatcher switches into this mode.
      As long as it is in this mode ONLY the selected DataInteractor will receive the event. This mode is ended when the DataInteractor switches back to
      a state without a tag/ or the REGULAR-tag.\n
      \note In this mode EventObservers will NOT receive the events.

   <li> \b Prefer \b Input: \n
      Basically works as Grab Input, with the difference that if the Interactor in an prefer input state, cannot process the event offered,
      it will be offered to the other interactors in the regular way.\n
      In this mode EventObservers ARE informed.

</ul>
\section StateMachineSection State Machine & Configuration

A  mitk::EventStateMachine points to a \b state, which in turn references  \b transitions
(which describe a change from one state to another) and \b actions (indicating which functions are executed when a transition is taken).
\dot
digraph {
  node [shape=record, fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10];
  d [ label="{StateMachine|m_CurrentState}" ];
  a [ label="{StateMachineState|m_Transitions}" ];
  b [ label="{StateMachineTransitions|m_Actions}"];
  c [ label="{StateMachineAction}"];
  edge [fontname=Helvetica, fontsize=10]
  d -> a [label="1 : 1"];
  a -> b [label="1 : n"];
  b -> c [label="1 : n"];
}
