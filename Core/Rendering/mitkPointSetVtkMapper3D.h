  /**
  * @brief Vtk-based mapper for PointSet
  *
  * Due to the need of different colors for selected 
  * and unselected points and the facts, that we also have a contour and 
  * labels for the points, the vtk structure is build up the following way: 
  *
  * We have two AppendPolyData, one selected, and one unselected and one 
  * for a contour between the points. Each one is connected to an own 
  * PolyDaraMapper and an Actor. The different color for the unselected and 
  * selected state and for the contour is read from properties.
  *
  * "unselectedcolor", "selectedcolor" and "contourcolor" are the strings, 
  * that are looked for. Pointlabels are added besides the selected or the 
  * deselected points.
  *
  * Then the three Actors are combined inside a vtkPropAssembly and this 
  * object is returned in GetProp() and so hooked up into the rendering 
  * pipeline. Other properties looked for are:
  *
  *   - \b "show contour": if set to on, lines between the points are shown
  *   - \b "close contour": if set to on, the open strip is closed (first point 
  *       connected with last point)
  *   - \b "pointsize": size of the points mapped
  *   - \b "label": text of the Points to show besides points
  *   - \b "contoursize": size of the contour drawn between the points 
  *       (if not set, the pointsize is taken)
  *
